# MyPM

A little project management app I'm working on, based on CakePHP.

## Installation

1. Download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
2. Run `php composer.phar install`.

If Composer is installed globally, run

```bash
composer install
```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.

## Configuration

Read and edit the environment specific `config/app_local.php` and setup the 
`'Datasources'` and any other configuration relevant for your application.
Other environment agnostic settings can be changed in `config/app.php`.

## Layout

The app skeleton uses [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) (v1.3) minimalist CSS
framework by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.
